# odin-recipes

# Project Description: 

This is a project I am doing as a part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It is a simple website in which I will link and describe various recipes, while including the various HTML/CSS elements I have larned so far to make it appealing. I plan on referencing the recipes from a website and include one appitizer, one main dish, and one dessert. This will be an interesting first project and I hope you enjoy it!
